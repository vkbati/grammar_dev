<center><h1>Exercise 4, Grammar Development</h1></center>

<p>For this exercise you can work
  with  <a href="grammar3.html">grammar3.lfg</a>, which contains first
  rules for adjectives and more complex rules for PPs. The grammar
  also makes a start on integrating punctuation. Note that XLE is set
  up to use a default tokenizer if nothing else is specified. In the past we
  have sometimes had trouble with the tokenizer.  If you find yourself having
  trouble use the tokenizers provided as part of the ParGram Starter
  Grammar. You need to download basic-parse-tok.fst and
  default-gen-tokenizer.fst and store them in the same place as your grammar (or
  store them elsewhere and adjust the paths in the MORPHOLOGY section of your
  grammar accordingly). Our grammar3.lfg has an appropriate command for the
  integration of these tokenziers in the
  MORPHOLOGY section which you would simply need to uncomment. 

<h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>

<p> Expand your grammar so that  it includes Adjectives and Adverbs.
That is, the  following sentences should also work (and provide sound
  linguistic analyses).  
<ul>

<li> the small dog slept 

<li> the small black dog slept

<li> the small black hungry dog ate bones 

<li> the gorilla devoured the banana quickly

<li> the small black hungry dog ate bones quickly

<li> the very small gorilla slept 

<li> the very very very small gorilla slept 

<li> the dog was given a bone by the girl

<li> a bone was given to the dog by the girl 

</ul>

<p> You will need to add adverbs to your lexicon and make sure that
you expand your rules to allow adverbs.  Note that you should also
change your treatment of adjectives, so that you have something like
the following:

<pre>
NP --> (D)
       AP*: ! $ (^ ADJUNCT);
       N. 

AP --> Adv*: ! $ (^ ADJUNCT);
      A.
</pre>

<p>That is, you should introduce an Adjective Phrase (AP) and allow
 adverbs to modify adjectives within this AP. 

<p>At the moment, the grammar does not include a treatment of commas. You should
expand the grammar to include a treatment of commas inbetween the adjectives,
see the section on Punctuation below. 

<h2>PPs and constraining equations</h2>

<p>The grammar <a href="grammar3.html">grammar3.lfg</a>
  already contains a start on implementing PPs.  Overall, you should
  be able to treat three kinds of PPs:  Adjuncts (with semantic Ps),
  OBLs with both semantic and non-semantic Ps. 

<p>The following sentences should work. Note that some of them will
  get more than one possible reading.  This is okay as long as the
  correct one is among them.  We will learn next time how to constrain
  the space of possibilities. 

<ul>

<li>the gorilla waited on the bench

<li>the zookeeper waited on the gorilla 

<li>the gorilla put the banana in the cage

<li>the gorilla in the cage devoured a banana

<li>the gorilla devoured a banana in the cage

<li>a banana was put in the cage by the gorilla

<li>the zookeeper waited by the bench 

<li>the zookeeper waited by the bench in the garden 

</ul>

<p>Note that in addition to the PPs in the VP, which are already there to some
  extent in <i>grammar5.lfg</i>, you are required to provide for the
  possibilities of PPs within an NP.  


 <h2>Punctuation</h2>

  <p>The grammar has made a start on integrating punctuation. You can
  add in more types.  Here are some sample lexical entries.  You will need
  to add them to appropriate places in the c-structure rules. Note
  that STMT-TYPE stands for "Statment Type".  

 <pre>
.  PERIOD  * (^ STMT-TYPE) = declarative.

,  COMMA * . 

!  EXCL * (^ STMT-TYPE) = exclamation. 

?  QM * (^ STMT-TYPE) = interrogative. 
</pre>

  <p>Change your grammar so that the following sentence works:

  <ul>
    <li>the small, black, dog slept. 
    
  </ul>
